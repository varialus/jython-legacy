Welcome to Jython 2.5.2 Beta2
=============================

This is the second beta release of the 2.5.2 version of Jython. This release
fixes a number of bugs and addresses memory and threading issues. See the NEWS file for
more details.

The release was compiled on Mac OS X with JDK 5 and requires JDK 5 to run.

Please try it out and report any bugs at http://bugs.jython.org.

And - last but not least - please help spread the word:
If companies still are using Jython 2.2.1, they really should start testing against 2.5.2 now.
