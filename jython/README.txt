Welcome to Jython 2.5rc1
========================

This is the first release candidate of the 2.5 version of Jython.  It contains
bug fixes and polish since the last beta.  One especially nice bit of polish is
that jline is enabled by default now, and so using up and down arrows should
work out of the box.  If no major bugs are found this release will get
re-labled and released as the production version of 2.5.0.

The release was compiled on Mac OS X with JDK 5 and requires JDK 5 to run.

Please try this out and report any bugs at http://bugs.jython.org.
