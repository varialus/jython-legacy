Welcome to Jython 2.5b4
=======================

This is the fifth beta of the 2.5 version of Jython.  It contains a new
implementation of List and Tuple, as well as a patch which helps Jython run in
an envrironment without file write access (specifically for use on Google App
Engine) There are also a number of smaller bug fixes.  This beta contains all
of the new features for the eventual 2.5 release continues the feature freeze.
We are very close, once this beta has been tested in the wild for a bit and we
close a few more high priority bugs, we will start release candidates.

The release was compiled on Mac OS X with JDK 5 and requires JDK 5 to run.

As a beta release, this release is incomplete and contains bugs.  Do not
use in a production environment.
