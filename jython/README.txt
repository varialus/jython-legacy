Welcome to Jython 2.5rc2
========================

This is the second release candidate of the 2.5 version of Jython (about 10
minutes after the first).  It fixes a windows bug with our jline support on
windows.  Below is the RC1 notes:

It contains bug fixes and polish since the last beta.  One especially nice bit
of polish is that jline is enabled by default now, and so using up and down
arrows should work out of the box.  If no major bugs are found this release
will get re-labled and released as the production version of 2.5.0.

The release was compiled on Mac OS X with JDK 5 and requires JDK 5 to run.

Please try this out and report any bugs at http://bugs.jython.org.
