What is a JEP?
==============


JEP stands for Jython Enhancement Proposal.  A JEP is a design
document providing information to the Python community, or describing
a new feature for Jython or its processes or environment.  The JEP
should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a
rationale for the feature.

For the most part JEPs will follow the purposes and guidelines followed
by PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals) see 'PEP 1'_
_PEP 1: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/

PEP 1 allows eicher plaintext (see 'PEP 9'_) or reStructuredText (see
'PEP 12'_) but please use only 'PEP 12'_ for JEPs.
