show/compare test results saved with regrtest.py -m RES option:

report.py res          : just show
report.py res old-res  : compare with old result

report.py [-locs LOCS] res [old-res]

LOCS is a file with lines:
<directory-path> = <nick>
...

see locs.example, useful to coalesce test locations so to be able to compare results from different machines...
