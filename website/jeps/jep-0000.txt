Introduction

    The JEP contains the index of all Jython Enhancement Proposals,
    known as JEPs.  JEP numbers are assigned by the JEP Editor, and
    once assigned are never changed.  The SVN history[1] of the JEP
    texts represent their historical record.

    JEPs are based on the concept of PEPs from CPython -- see 
    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/ for the PEP on which this index
    was based.
