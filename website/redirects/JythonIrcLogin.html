        Throughout the day, many Jython developers and users are available for chat via the irc.freenode.net channel. Please feel free to post Jython questions on the channel. Do not worry if you do not receive a prompt response as many folks have IRC running in the background, someone should eventually respond.
     <br/><br/>
If you wish to join, just use your favorite IRC client and point it to irc.freenode.net, channel #jython or use this link if you already have a client installed <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#jython">irc://irc.freenode.net/#jython</a>
