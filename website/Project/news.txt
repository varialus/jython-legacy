**7th February 2007: Jython-2.2beta1**

At long last a beta of Jython-2.2 is out the door.  This release
contains all of the major features for a 2.2 release, so it's a
significant milestone towards 2.2 proper.  It's being released to
solicit feedback about any bugs or missing features; if you can, `download it <http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jython/jython_Release_2_2beta1.jar?download>`__
and check for issues.  Bug reports
can be created at http://www.jython.org/bugs whereas more general
questions can be asked on the `Jython-users mailing list <http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=12867>`__ or #jython on
irc.freenode.net.

The current plan calls for a second beta release with several known
CPython compatibility issues and bugs fixed, and then a progression of
as few release candidates as possible to create a stable Jython 2.2.
See the `roadmap <roadmap.html>`__ for more details about the future
of Jython.
Once the second beta is created, the bar will be set even higher for
changes, so now is the best time to send in bugs and patches.

Samuele Pedroni, Guido van Rossum and Sean McGrath represent the Python community at a dynamic languages summit. Hosted by Tim Bray of Sun.

**25 October 2004: Progress on new-style classes implementation**

Samuele Pedroni is making strong progress in the end-to-end modifications required to the Jython code-base in order to support new-style classes. The implementation of new style classes in Jython is a key moment on the road to compatibility with CPython 2.3 and beyond. Samuele plans to make an initial check-in of the branch on or around 15 November 2004. Stay tuned for further updates.

**25 October 2004: Jython tutorial**
Barry Feigenbaum has written a substantial two part Jython tutorial on using Jython. The tutorial consists of two PDF files: Part 1 (82 pages) and Part 2 (100 pages). First published by IBM developerWorks at http://www.ibm.com/developerWorks/.

**April 2004: Newstyle branch work**
Work is undergoing since the beginning of the year to implement new-style classes features (the biggest quantum-leap post 2.1 missing feature for a new release) on the newstyle-branch in the CVS. There will be a new alpha release when this branch will be merged to the trunk. We expect then a new release for the summer, with 2.2 and some 2.3 features. Leading up to the release this site will be revamped.

**31 July 2003: Jython 2.2 alpha 0 available**
Experimental, unstable release of Jython now available. This is an alpha release, in that it is not feature complete for a Jython 2.2 release, and there are significant known issues.

This is a snapshot that contains a mixture of Python 2.1 and 2.2 features. Use this release at your own risk.

There has been no validation of which parts of the Python library are functional with this relase. Expect pickle and related modules to be broken, probably others as well.
