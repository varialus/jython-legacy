<dl class="docutils">
<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></tt></dt>
<dd>The default Python prompt of the interactive shell.  Often seen for
code examples which can be executed interactively in the
interpreter.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">...</span></tt></dt>
<dd>The default Python prompt of the interactive shell when entering
code for an indented code block or within a pair of matching left
and right delimiters (parentheses, square brackets or curly
braces).</dd>
<dt>2to3</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A tool that tries to convert Python 2.x code to Python 3.x code by
handling most of the incompatibilites which can be detected by
parsing the source and traversing the parse tree.</p>
<p class="last">2to3 is available in the standard library as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib2to3</span></tt>; a
standalone entry point is provided as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Tools/scripts/2to3</span></tt>.  See
<em>2to3 - Automated Python 2 to 3 code translation</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>abstract base class</dt>
<dd>Abstract Base Classes (abbreviated ABCs) complement <em>duck-typing</em>
by providing a way to define interfaces when other techniques like
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hasattr()</span></tt> would be clumsy. Python comes with many builtin ABCs
for data structures (in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">collections</span></tt> module), numbers (in
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">numbers</span></tt> module), and streams (in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">io</span></tt> module). You
can create your own ABC with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">abc</span></tt> module.</dd>
<dt>argument</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A value passed to a function or method, assigned to a named local
variable in the function body.  A function or method may have both
positional arguments and keyword arguments in its definition.
Positional and keyword arguments may be variable-length: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></tt>
accepts or passes (if in the function definition or call) several
positional arguments in a list, while <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**</span></tt> does the same for
keyword arguments in a dictionary.</p>
<p class="last">Any expression may be used within the argument list, and the
evaluated value is passed to the local variable.</p>
</dd>
<dt>attribute</dt>
<dd>A value associated with an object which is referenced by name using
dotted expressions.  For example, if an object <em>o</em> has an attribute
<em>a</em> it would be referenced as <em>o.a</em>.</dd>
<dt>BDFL</dt>
<dd>Benevolent Dictator For Life, a.k.a. Guido van Rossum, Python&#8217;s
creator.</dd>
<dt>bytecode</dt>
<dd>Python source code is compiled into bytecode, the internal
representation of a Python program in the interpreter.  The
bytecode is also cached in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.pyc</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.pyo</span></tt> files so that
executing the same file is faster the second time (recompilation
from source to bytecode can be avoided).  This &#8220;intermediate
language&#8221; is said to run on a <em>virtual machine</em> that executes the
machine code corresponding to each bytecode.</dd>
<dt>class</dt>
<dd>A template for creating user-defined objects. Class definitions
normally contain method definitions which operate on instances of
the class.</dd>
<dt>classic class</dt>
<dd>Any class which does not inherit from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">object</span></tt>.  See <em>new-style
class</em>.  Classic classes will be removed in Python 3.0.</dd>
<dt>coercion</dt>
<dd>The implicit conversion of an instance of one type to another
during an operation which involves two arguments of the same type.
For example, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">int(3.15)</span></tt> converts the floating point number to
the integer <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3</span></tt>, but in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3+4.5</span></tt>, each argument is of a
different type (one int, one float), and both must be converted to
the same type before they can be added or it will raise a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TypeError</span></tt>.  Coercion between two operands can be performed with
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">coerce</span></tt> builtin function; thus, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3+4.5</span></tt> is equivalent to
calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">operator.add(*coerce(3,</span> <span class="pre">4.5))</span></tt> and results in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">operator.add(3.0,</span> <span class="pre">4.5)</span></tt>.  Without coercion, all arguments of
even compatible types would have to be normalized to the same value
by the programmer, e.g., <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">float(3)+4.5</span></tt> rather than just
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3+4.5</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>complex number</dt>
<dd>An extension of the familiar real number system in which all
numbers are expressed as a sum of a real part and an imaginary
part.  Imaginary numbers are real multiples of the imaginary unit
(the square root of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-1</span></tt>), often written <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></tt> in mathematics or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">j</span></tt> in engineering. Python has builtin support for complex
numbers, which are written with this latter notation; the imaginary
part is written with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">j</span></tt> suffix, e.g., <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3+1j</span></tt>.  To get access
to complex equivalents of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">math</span></tt> module, use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cmath</span></tt>.  Use
of complex numbers is a fairly advanced mathematical feature.  If
you&#8217;re not aware of a need for them, it&#8217;s almost certain you can
safely ignore them.</dd>
<dt>context manager</dt>
<dd>An object which controls the environment seen in a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">with</span></tt>
statement by defining <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__enter__()</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__exit__()</span></tt> methods.
See <strong>PEP 343</strong>.</dd>
<dt>CPython</dt>
<dd>The canonical implementation of the Python programming language.
The term &#8220;CPython&#8221; is used in contexts when necessary to
distinguish this implementation from others such as Jython or
IronPython.</dd>
<dt>decorator</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A function returning another function, usually applied as a
function transformation using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;wrapper</span></tt> syntax.  Common
examples for decorators are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">classmethod()</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">staticmethod()</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The decorator syntax is merely syntactic sugar, the following two
function definitions are semantically equivalent:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>def f(...):</dt>
<dd>...</dd>
</dl>
<p>f = staticmethod(f)</p>
<p>&#64;staticmethod
def f(...):</p>
<blockquote>
...</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="last">See <em>the documentation for function definition</em> for more about
decorators.</p>
</dd>
<dt>descriptor</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Any <em>new-style</em> object which defines the methods <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__get__()</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__set__()</span></tt>, or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__delete__()</span></tt>.  When a class attribute is a
descriptor, its special binding behavior is triggered upon
attribute lookup.  Normally, using <em>a.b</em> to get, set or delete an
attribute looks up the object named <em>b</em> in the class dictionary for
<em>a</em>, but if <em>b</em> is a descriptor, the respective descriptor method
gets called.  Understanding descriptors is a key to a deep
understanding of Python because they are the basis for many
features including functions, methods, properties, class methods,
static methods, and reference to super classes.</p>
<p class="last">For more information about descriptors&#8217; methods, see <em>Implementing
Descriptors</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>dictionary</dt>
<dd>An associative array, where arbitrary keys are mapped to values.
The use of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dict</span></tt> closely resembles that for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">list</span></tt>, but the
keys can be any object with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__hash__()</span></tt> function, not just
integers. Called a hash in Perl.</dd>
<dt>docstring</dt>
<dd>A string literal which appears as the first expression in a class,
function or module.  While ignored when the suite is executed, it
is recognized by the compiler and put into the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__doc__</span></tt>
attribute of the enclosing class, function or module.  Since it is
available via introspection, it is the canonical place for
documentation of the object.</dd>
<dt>duck-typing</dt>
<dd>A pythonic programming style which determines an object&#8217;s type by
inspection of its method or attribute signature rather than by
explicit relationship to some type object (&#8220;If it looks like a duck
and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.&#8221;)  By emphasizing
interfaces rather than specific types, well-designed code improves
its flexibility by allowing polymorphic substitution.  Duck-typing
avoids tests using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type()</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">isinstance()</span></tt>. (Note, however,
that duck-typing can be complemented with abstract base classes.)
Instead, it typically employs <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hasattr()</span></tt> tests or <em>EAFP</em>
programming.</dd>
<dt>EAFP</dt>
<dd>Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.  This common Python
coding style assumes the existence of valid keys or attributes and
catches exceptions if the assumption proves false.  This clean and
fast style is characterized by the presence of many <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">try</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">except</span></tt> statements.  The technique contrasts with the <em>LBYL</em>
style common to many other languages such as C.</dd>
<dt>expression</dt>
<dd>A piece of syntax which can be evaluated to some value.  In other
words, an expression is an accumulation of expression elements like
literals, names, attribute access, operators or function calls
which all return a value. In contrast to many other languages, not
all language constructs are expressions. There are also
<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>statement*s which cannot be used as expressions, such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">print</span></tt>
or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt>.  Assignments are also statements, not expressions.</dd>
<dt>extension module</dt>
<dd>A module written in C or C++, using Python&#8217;s C API to interact with
the core and with user code.</dd>
<dt>finder</dt>
<dd>An object that tries to find the <em>loader</em> for a module. It must
implement a method named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find_module()</span></tt>. See <strong>PEP 302</strong> for
details.</dd>
<dt>function</dt>
<dd>A series of statements which returns some value to a caller. It can
also be passed zero or more arguments which may be used in the
execution of the body. See also <em>argument</em> and <em>method</em>.</dd>
<dt>__future__</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A pseudo module which programmers can use to enable new language
features which are not compatible with the current interpreter.
For example, the expression <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">11/4</span></tt> currently evaluates to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2</span></tt>.
If the module in which it is executed had enabled <em>true division</em>
by executing:</p>
<blockquote>
from __future__ import division</blockquote>
<p>the expression <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">11/4</span></tt> would evaluate to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2.75</span></tt>.  By importing
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__future__</span></tt> module and evaluating its variables, you can see
when a new feature was first added to the language and when it will
become the default:</p>
<div class="last highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">__future__</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">__future__</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">division</span>
<span class="go">_Feature((2, 2, 0, &#39;alpha&#39;, 2), (3, 0, 0, &#39;alpha&#39;, 0), 8192)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>garbage collection</dt>
<dd>The process of freeing memory when it is not used anymore.  Python
performs garbage collection via reference counting and a cyclic
garbage collector that is able to detect and break reference
cycles.</dd>
<dt>generator</dt>
<dd>A function which returns an iterator.  It looks like a normal
function except that values are returned to the caller using a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">yield</span></tt> statement instead of a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">return</span></tt> statement.  Generator
functions often contain one or more <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">while</span></tt> loops
which <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">yield</span></tt> elements back to the caller.  The function
execution is stopped at the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">yield</span></tt> keyword (returning the
result) and is resumed there when the next element is requested by
calling the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">next()</span></tt> method of the returned iterator.</dd>
<dt>generator expression</dt>
<dd><p class="first">An expression that returns a generator.  It looks like a normal
expression followed by a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> expression defining a loop
variable, range, and an optional <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt> expression.  The combined
expression generates values for an enclosing function:</p>
<div class="last highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">10</span><span class="p">))</span>         <span class="c"># sum of squares 0, 1, 4, ... 81</span>
<span class="go">285</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>GIL</dt>
<dd>See <em>global interpreter lock</em>.</dd>
<dt>global interpreter lock</dt>
<dd>The lock used by Python threads to assure that only one thread
executes in the <em>CPython</em> <em>virtual machine</em> at a time. This
simplifies the CPython implementation by assuring that no two
processes can access the same memory at the same time.  Locking the
entire interpreter makes it easier for the interpreter to be multi-
threaded, at the expense of much of the parallelism afforded by
multi-processor machines.  Efforts have been made in the past to
create a &#8220;free-threaded&#8221; interpreter (one which locks shared data
at a much finer granularity), but so far none have been successful
because performance suffered in the common single-processor case.</dd>
<dt>hashable</dt>
<dd><p class="first">An object is <em>hashable</em> if it has a hash value which never changes
during its lifetime (it needs a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__hash__()</span></tt> method), and can be
compared to other objects (it needs an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__eq__()</span></tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__cmp__()</span></tt> method). Hashable objects which compare equal must
have the same hash value.</p>
<p>Hashability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set
member, because these data structures use the hash value
internally.</p>
<p class="last">All of Python&#8217;s immutable built-in objects are hashable, while no
mutable containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are.  Objects
which are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by
default; they all compare unequal, and their hash value is their
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">id()</span></tt>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>IDLE</dt>
<dd>An Integrated Development Environment for Python.  IDLE is a basic
editor and interpreter environment which ships with the standard
distribution of Python.  Good for beginners, it also serves as
clear example code for those wanting to implement a moderately
sophisticated, multi-platform GUI application.</dd>
<dt>immutable</dt>
<dd>An object with a fixed value.  Immutable objects include numbers,
strings and tuples.  Such an object cannot be altered.  A new
object has to be created if a different value has to be stored.
They play an important role in places where a constant hash value
is needed, for example as a key in a dictionary.</dd>
<dt>integer division</dt>
<dd>Mathematical division discarding any remainder.  For example, the
expression <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">11/4</span></tt> currently evaluates to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2</span></tt> in contrast to the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2.75</span></tt> returned by float division.  Also called <em>floor division</em>.
When dividing two integers the outcome will always be another
integer (having the floor function applied to it). However, if one
of the operands is another numeric type (such as a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">float</span></tt>), the
result will be coerced (see <em>coercion</em>) to a common type.  For
example, an integer divided by a float will result in a float
value, possibly with a decimal fraction.  Integer division can be
forced by using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">//</span></tt> operator instead of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></tt> operator.
See also <em>__future__</em>.</dd>
<dt>importer</dt>
<dd>An object that both finds and loads a module; both a <em>finder</em> and
<em>loader</em> object.</dd>
<dt>interactive</dt>
<dd>Python has an interactive interpreter which means you can enter
statements and expressions at the interpreter prompt, immediately
execute them and see their results.  Just launch <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></tt> with no
arguments (possibly by selecting it from your computer&#8217;s main
menu). It is a very powerful way to test out new ideas or inspect
modules and packages (remember <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">help(x)</span></tt>).</dd>
<dt>interpreted</dt>
<dd>Python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled one,
though the distinction can be blurry because of the presence of the
bytecode compiler.  This means that source files can be run
directly without explicitly creating an executable which is then
run. Interpreted languages typically have a shorter
development/debug cycle than compiled ones, though their programs
generally also run more slowly.  See also <em>interactive</em>.</dd>
<dt>iterable</dt>
<dd>A container object capable of returning its members one at a time.
Examples of iterables include all sequence types (such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">list</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">str</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tuple</span></tt>) and some non-sequence types like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dict</span></tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">file</span></tt> and objects of any classes you define with an
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__iter__()</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__getitem__()</span></tt> method.  Iterables can be used
in a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> loop and in many other places where a sequence is
needed (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">zip()</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">map()</span></tt>, ...).  When an iterable object is
passed as an argument to the builtin function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">iter()</span></tt>, it
returns an iterator for the object.  This iterator is good for one
pass over the set of values.  When using iterables, it is usually
not necessary to call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">iter()</span></tt> or deal with iterator objects
yourself.  The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> statement does that automatically for you,
creating a temporary unnamed variable to hold the iterator for the
duration of the loop.  See also <em>iterator</em>, <em>sequence</em>, and
<em>generator</em>.</dd>
<dt>iterator</dt>
<dd><p class="first">An object representing a stream of data.  Repeated calls to the
iterator&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">next()</span></tt> method return successive items in the stream.
When no more data are available a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">StopIteration</span></tt> exception is
raised instead.  At this point, the iterator object is exhausted
and any further calls to its <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">next()</span></tt> method just raise
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">StopIteration</span></tt> again.  Iterators are required to have an
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__iter__()</span></tt> method that returns the iterator object itself so
every iterator is also iterable and may be used in most places
where other iterables are accepted.  One notable exception is code
which attempts multiple iteration passes.  A container object (such
as a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">list</span></tt>) produces a fresh new iterator each time you pass it
to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">iter()</span></tt> function or use it in a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> loop.  Attempting
this with an iterator will just return the same exhausted iterator
object used in the previous iteration pass, making it appear like
an empty container.</p>
<p class="last">More information can be found in <em>Iterator Types</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>keyword argument</dt>
<dd>Arguments which are preceded with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">variable_name=</span></tt> in the call.
The variable name designates the local name in the function to
which the value is assigned.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">**</span></tt> is used to accept or pass a
dictionary of keyword arguments.  See <em>argument</em>.</dd>
<dt>lambda</dt>
<dd>An anonymous inline function consisting of a single <em>expression</em>
which is evaluated when the function is called.  The syntax to
create a lambda function is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lambda</span> <span class="pre">[arguments]:</span> <span class="pre">expression</span></tt></dd>
<dt>LBYL</dt>
<dd>Look before you leap.  This coding style explicitly tests for pre-
conditions before making calls or lookups.  This style contrasts
with the <em>EAFP</em> approach and is characterized by the presence of
many <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt> statements.</dd>
<dt>list</dt>
<dd>A built-in Python <em>sequence</em>.  Despite its name it is more akin to
an array in other languages than to a linked list since access to
elements are O(1).</dd>
<dt>list comprehension</dt>
<dd>A compact way to process all or part of the elements in a sequence
and return a list with the results.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">result</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">[&quot;0x%02x&quot;</span> <span class="pre">%</span> <span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">x</span>
<span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">range(256)</span> <span class="pre">if</span> <span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">%</span> <span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">0]</span></tt> generates a list of strings
containing even hex numbers (0x..) in the range from 0 to 255. The
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt> clause is optional.  If omitted, all elements in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">range(256)</span></tt> are processed.</dd>
<dt>loader</dt>
<dd>An object that loads a module. It must define a method named
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load_module()</span></tt>. A loader is typically returned by a <em>finder</em>.
See <strong>PEP 302</strong> for details.</dd>
<dt>mapping</dt>
<dd>A container object (such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dict</span></tt>) which supports arbitrary key
lookups using the special method <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__getitem__()</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>metaclass</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The class of a class.  Class definitions create a class name, a
class dictionary, and a list of base classes.  The metaclass is
responsible for taking those three arguments and creating the
class.  Most object oriented programming languages provide a
default implementation.  What makes Python special is that it is
possible to create custom metaclasses.  Most users never need this
tool, but when the need arises, metaclasses can provide powerful,
elegant solutions.  They have been used for logging attribute
access, adding thread-safety, tracking object creation,
implementing singletons, and many other tasks.</p>
<p class="last">More information can be found in <em>Customizing class creation</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>method</dt>
<dd>A function which is defined inside a class body.  If called as an
attribute of an instance of that class, the method will get the
instance object as its first <em>argument</em> (which is usually called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">self</span></tt>). See <em>function</em> and <em>nested scope</em>.</dd>
<dt>mutable</dt>
<dd>Mutable objects can change their value but keep their <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">id()</span></tt>.
See also <em>immutable</em>.</dd>
<dt>named tuple</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Any tuple-like class whose indexable elements are also accessible
using named attributes (for example, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">time.localtime()</span></tt> returns a
tuple-like object where the <em>year</em> is accessible either with an
index such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t[0]</span></tt> or with a named attribute like
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t.tm_year</span></tt>).</p>
<p class="last">A named tuple can be a built-in type such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">time.struct_time</span></tt>,
or it can be created with a regular class definition.  A full
featured named tuple can also be created with the factory function
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">collections.namedtuple()</span></tt>.  The latter approach automatically
provides extra features such as a self-documenting representation
like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Employee(name='jones',</span> <span class="pre">title='programmer')</span></tt>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>namespace</dt>
<dd>The place where a variable is stored.  Namespaces are implemented
as dictionaries.  There are the local, global and builtin
namespaces as well as nested namespaces in objects (in methods).
Namespaces support modularity by preventing naming conflicts.  For
instance, the functions <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__builtin__.open()</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">os.open()</span></tt>
are distinguished by their namespaces.  Namespaces also aid
readability and maintainability by making it clear which module
implements a function.  For instance, writing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">random.seed()</span></tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">itertools.izip()</span></tt> makes it clear that those functions are
implemented by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">random</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">itertools</span></tt> modules,
respectively.</dd>
<dt>nested scope</dt>
<dd>The ability to refer to a variable in an enclosing definition.  For
instance, a function defined inside another function can refer to
variables in the outer function.  Note that nested scopes work only
for reference and not for assignment which will always write to the
innermost scope.  In contrast, local variables both read and write
in the innermost scope.  Likewise, global variables read and write
to the global namespace.</dd>
<dt>new-style class</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Any class which inherits from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">object</span></tt>.  This includes all built-
in types like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">list</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dict</span></tt>.  Only new-style classes can
use Python&#8217;s newer, versatile features like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__slots__</span></tt>,
descriptors, properties, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__getattribute__()</span></tt>.</p>
<p class="last">More information can be found in <em>New-style and classic classes</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>object</dt>
<dd>Any data with state (attributes or value) and defined behavior
(methods).  Also the ultimate base class of any <em>new-style class</em>.</dd>
<dt>positional argument</dt>
<dd>The arguments assigned to local names inside a function or method,
determined by the order in which they were given in the call.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></tt> is used to either accept multiple positional arguments (when
in the definition), or pass several arguments as a list to a
function.  See <em>argument</em>.</dd>
<dt>Python 3000</dt>
<dd>Nickname for the next major Python version, 3.0 (coined long ago
when the release of version 3 was something in the distant future.)
This is also abbreviated &#8220;Py3k&#8221;.</dd>
<dt>Pythonic</dt>
<dd><p class="first">An idea or piece of code which closely follows the most common
idioms of the Python language, rather than implementing code using
concepts common to other languages.  For example, a common idiom in
Python is to loop over all elements of an iterable using a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt>
statement.  Many other languages don&#8217;t have this type of construct,
so people unfamiliar with Python sometimes use a numerical counter
instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>for i in range(len(food)):</dt>
<dd>print food[i]</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>As opposed to the cleaner, Pythonic method:</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>for piece in food:</dt>
<dd>print piece</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>reference count</dt>
<dd>The number of references to an object.  When the reference count of
an object drops to zero, it is deallocated.  Reference counting is
generally not visible to Python code, but it is a key element of
the <em>CPython</em> implementation.  The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sys</span></tt> module defines a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getrefcount()</span></tt> function that programmers can call to return the
reference count for a particular object.</dd>
<dt>__slots__</dt>
<dd>A declaration inside a <em>new-style class</em> that saves memory by pre-
declaring space for instance attributes and eliminating instance
dictionaries.  Though popular, the technique is somewhat tricky to
get right and is best reserved for rare cases where there are large
numbers of instances in a memory-critical application.</dd>
<dt>sequence</dt>
<dd>An <em>iterable</em> which supports efficient element access using integer
indices via the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__getitem__()</span></tt> special method and defines a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">len()</span></tt> method that returns the length of the sequence. Some
built-in sequence types are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">list</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">str</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tuple</span></tt>, and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unicode</span></tt>. Note that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dict</span></tt> also supports <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__getitem__()</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__len__()</span></tt>, but is considered a mapping rather than a sequence
because the lookups use arbitrary <em>immutable</em> keys rather than
integers.</dd>
<dt>slice</dt>
<dd>An object usually containing a portion of a <em>sequence</em>.  A slice is
created using the subscript notation, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[]</span></tt> with colons between
numbers when several are given, such as in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">variable_name[1:3:5]</span></tt>.  The bracket (subscript) notation uses
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">slice</span></tt> objects internally (or in older versions,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__getslice__()</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__setslice__()</span></tt>).</dd>
<dt>special method</dt>
<dd>A method that is called implicitly by Python to execute a certain
operation on a type, such as addition.  Such methods have names
starting and ending with double underscores.  Special methods are
documented in <em>Special method names</em>.</dd>
<dt>statement</dt>
<dd>A statement is part of a suite (a &#8220;block&#8221; of code).  A statement is
either an <em>expression</em> or a one of several constructs with a
keyword, such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">while</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">print</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>triple-quoted string</dt>
<dd>A string which is bound by three instances of either a quotation
mark (&#8220;) or an apostrophe (&#8216;).  While they don&#8217;t provide any
functionality not available with single-quoted strings, they are
useful for a number of reasons.  They allow you to include
unescaped single and double quotes within a string and they can
span multiple lines without the use of the continuation character,
making them especially useful when writing docstrings.</dd>
<dt>type</dt>
<dd>The type of a Python object determines what kind of object it is;
every object has a type.  An object&#8217;s type is accessible as its
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__class__</span></tt> attribute or can be retrieved with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">type(obj)</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>virtual machine</dt>
<dd>A computer defined entirely in software.  Python&#8217;s virtual machine
executes the <em>bytecode</em> emitted by the bytecode compiler.</dd>
<dt>Zen of Python</dt>
<dd>Listing of Python design principles and philosophies that are
helpful in understanding and using the language.  The listing can
be found by typing &#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">this</span></tt>&#8221; at the interactive prompt.</dd>
