Data Types
**********

The modules described in this chapter provide a variety of specialized data
types such as dates and times, fixed-type arrays, heap queues, synchronized
queues, and sets.

Python also provides some built-in data types, in particular,
:class:`dict`, :class:`list`, :class:`set` (which along with
:class:`frozenset`, replaces the deprecated :mod:`sets` module), and
:class:`tuple`. The :class:`str` class can be used to handle binary data
and 8-bit text, and the :class:`unicode` class to handle Unicode text.

The following modules are documented in this chapter:
