  The Python Standard Library and What Comes with Jython
########################################################

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

While :ref:`reference-index` describes the exact syntax and
semantics of the Python language, this library reference manual
describes the standard library that is distributed with Jython. It also
describes some of the optional components that are commonly included
in Python distributions.

Python's standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of
facilities. The
library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to
system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be
inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python
that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in
everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to
encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting
away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.

Unlike the CPython distribution, Jython does not include built-in
libraries written in C as they will not work on the Java platform.  Instead,
there are certain libraries that have been re-written in the Java languages
to be included with Jython.  Likewise, *most* of the modules written
in Python are included with the Jython distribution as any Python that
does not use C extensions *should* work on Jython.

In addition to the standard library, there is a growing collection of
several thousand components (from individual programs and modules to
packages and entire application development frameworks), available from
the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_.  Many of these can
be used with Jython as well.

**Note that this portion of the documentation is currently in progress, and therefore, it is incomplete at this time.**
