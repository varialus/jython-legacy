<h1 class="title">Jython News</h1>
<p><strong>14th October 2007: Jython-2.2.1</strong></p>
<p>Jython 2.2.1 is available for <a class="reference" href="download.html">download</a>.  There have been no changes from rc2 to this release.  See the <a class="reference" href="../NEWS">changelog</a> for the full list of changes from 2.2 to 2.2.1.</p>
<p><strong>4th October 2007: Jython-2.2.1rc2</strong></p>
<p>A second release candidate for Jython 2.2.1 is available for <a class="reference" href="download.html">download</a>.  This candidate removes a couple more places that Jython used the JVM's default encoding.  See the <a class="reference" href="../NEWS">changelog</a> for the full list.</p>
<p><strong>24th September 2007: Jython-2.2.1rc1</strong></p>
<p>A release candidate for Jython 2.2.1, a bugfix release for 2.2, is available for <a class="reference" href="download.html">download</a>.  The <a class="reference" href="../NEWS">changelog</a> has the complete list of bugs fixed.</p>
<p><strong>22nd August 2007: Jython-2.2</strong></p>
<p>Jython 2.2, the first production release of Jython in nearly six years, is now available for <a class="reference" href="download.html">download</a>.  Its feature set is equivalent to the 2.2 release of CPython.  Only the version numbers changed from rc3 to this release; the code is identical otherwise.  The <a class="reference" href="../NEWS">changelog</a> has a more complete list of the changes from 2.1 to 2.2.</p>
<p><strong>2nd August 2007: Jython-2.2rc3</strong></p>
<p>The third release candidate for Jython 2.2 is now available for <a class="reference" href="download.html">download</a>.  Several bugs have been fixed from the second candidate.  See the NEWS file in the install for details.</p>
<p><strong>10th July 2007: Jython-2.2rc2</strong></p>
<p>The second release candidate for Jython 2.2 is now available for <a class="reference" href="download.html">download</a>.  Several bugs have been fixed from the first candidate.  See the NEWS file in the install for details.</p>
<p><strong>23rd June 2007: Jython-2.2rc1</strong></p>
<p>The first release candidate for Jython 2.2 is now available for <a class="reference" href="download.html">download</a>.   This release includes a new implementation of socket with non-blocking socket and SSL support.  It also contains many bugfixes.  See the NEWS file in the install for more detail.</p>
<p>If no major bugs are found in this candidate, the code in it will become the 2.2 release in a couple weeks.</p>
<p><strong>10th May 2007: Jython-2.2beta2</strong></p>
<p>The second beta for Jython 2.2 is now available for <a class="reference" href="download.html">download</a>.   Since the
previous beta over 30 bugs have been fixed and the last issues involving
new-style class integration have been resolved.</p>
<p>This is the final beta on the road to 2.2.  Please check it out and let us know of any issues before the final 2.2 release.</p>
<p><strong>7th February 2007: Jython-2.2beta1</strong></p>
<p>At long last a beta of Jython-2.2 is out the door.  This release
contains all of the major features for a 2.2 release, so it's a
significant milestone towards 2.2 proper.  It's being released to
solicit feedback about any bugs or missing features; if you can, <a class="reference" href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jython/jython_Release_2_2beta1.jar?download">download it</a>
and check for issues.  Bug reports
can be created at <a class="reference" href="http://www.jython.org/bugs">http://www.jython.org/bugs</a> whereas more general
questions can be asked on the <a class="reference" href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=12867">Jython-users mailing list</a> or #jython on
irc.freenode.net.</p>
<p>The current plan calls for a second beta release with several known
CPython compatibility issues and bugs fixed, and then a progression of
as few release candidates as possible to create a stable Jython 2.2.
See the <a class="reference" href="roadmap.html">roadmap</a> for more details about the future
of Jython.
Once the second beta is created, the bar will be set even higher for
changes, so now is the best time to send in bugs and patches.</p>
<p><strong>16th March 2005</strong></p>
<p>Jython support in NetBeans has been announced as part of a more general dynamic languages support initiative for NetBeans called Coyote. See blog entries by Tim Bray and Simon Phipps of Sun Microsystems.</p>
<p><strong>14th February 2005</strong></p>
<p>The <a class="reference" href="http://wiki.python.org/jython/">Jython wiki</a> is up and running. Thanks to Bill de hOra who did much of the running to get this set up.</p>
<p><strong>24th January 2005</strong></p>
<p>Brian Zimmer has started a Jython development blog : <a class="reference" href="http://www.ziclix.com/bzimmer/">http://www.ziclix.com/bzimmer/</a></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> Brian has since moved on.</p>
<p>Frank Wierzbicki, the new primary maintainer, has <a class="reference" href="http://fwierzbicki.blogspot.com/">a blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>14 January 2005</strong></p>
<p>The PSF recently published its list of projects to recieve grant funding. Brian Zimmer will manage the project Moving Jython Forward.</p>
<p><strong>19 December 2004</strong></p>
<p>Samuele Pedroni, Guido van Rossum and Sean McGrath represent the Python community at a dynamic languages summit. Hosted by Tim Bray of Sun.</p>
<p><strong>25 October 2004: Progress on new-style classes implementation</strong></p>
<p>Samuele Pedroni is making strong progress in the end-to-end modifications required to the Jython code-base in order to support new-style classes. The implementation of new style classes in Jython is a key moment on the road to compatibility with CPython 2.3 and beyond. Samuele plans to make an initial check-in of the branch on or around 15 November 2004. Stay tuned for further updates.</p>
<p><strong>25 October 2004: Jython tutorial</strong>
Barry Feigenbaum has written a substantial two part Jython tutorial on using Jython. The tutorial consists of two PDF files: Part 1 (82 pages) and Part 2 (100 pages). First published by IBM developerWorks at <a class="reference" href="http://www.ibm.com/developerWorks/">http://www.ibm.com/developerWorks/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>April 2004: Newstyle branch work</strong>
Work is undergoing since the beginning of the year to implement new-style classes features (the biggest quantum-leap post 2.1 missing feature for a new release) on the newstyle-branch in the CVS. There will be a new alpha release when this branch will be merged to the trunk. We expect then a new release for the summer, with 2.2 and some 2.3 features. Leading up to the release this site will be revamped.</p>
<p><strong>31 July 2003: Jython 2.2 alpha 0 available</strong>
Experimental, unstable release of Jython now available. This is an alpha release, in that it is not feature complete for a Jython 2.2 release, and there are significant known issues.</p>
<p>This is a snapshot that contains a mixture of Python 2.1 and 2.2 features. Use this release at your own risk.</p>
<p>There has been no validation of which parts of the Python library are functional with this relase. Expect pickle and related modules to be broken, probably others as well.</p>
