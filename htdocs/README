This directory contains the "source" for the jython website. The html 
pagaes are generated by the ht2html tool which must be installed 
separately:

   http://www.python.org/~bwarsaw/software/pyware.html

See the Makefile for details on how the pages are generated.

(Each page must be generated separately. Giving multiple ht-files as argument 
to ht2html does not work for me)

Makefile        Generates the .html files from .ht files. Works on 
                windows (nmake) and should also work on unix.

links.h         List of links to the sidebar on each webpage.

applets/        The example applets.

docs/           The documentation. This is just a placeholder for the
                files from jython/Doc. See docs/README for details.
