This directory contains the "source" for the jython website. The html 
pages are generated by the ht2html tool which must be installed 
separately:

   http://www.python.org/~bwarsaw/software/pyware.html

See the build.xml for details on how the pages are generated.

(Each page must be generated separately. Giving multiple ht-files as argument 
to ht2html does not work for me)

build.xml       Generates the .html files from .ht files. It is
                necessary to install bsf in the ant/lib directory
                for this to work.

links.h         List of links to the sidebar on each webpage.

applets/        The example applets.

docs/           The documentation. This is just a placeholder for the
                files from jython/Doc. See docs/README for details.

images/         Gif files used by the website.
