This directory contains applet demos. The html files are generated by ht2html.
See ../README for details.

The demo applets exists in jython/Demo/applet and the applet appletdemo.jar 
file is created by this command in the Demo/applet directory:

   jythonc --core --deep --jar appletdemo.jar *.py

Remember that the applets must be compiled with the same version of java as 
they will use in the browser. The demo applets on the website must be 
compiled with a JDK1.1. I have used JDK1.1.7A


appletdemo.jar:	        This file is create by the command above.

appletdemo.cab          Can only be created on a windows platform.
                        The files in appletdemo.jar are extracted 
                        into an empty temporary directory and the
                        .cab file is then created by running:

                            CABARC N appletdemo.cab *

                        CABARC is part of the MS-SDK for java
